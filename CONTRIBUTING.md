If there are rules that you wish to alter for your particular project, feel free to do so in your own `.eslintrc`. Rule declarations you make there will override the rules declared by this configuration. If you feel that a particular rule choice is poor and should be changed for all projects using this configuration, please open a PR [against this repo on Github](https://github.com/Shopify/eslint-config-shopify).

For changes to existing rules, bump the major version. For addition of new rules, bump the minor version. For all other corrections and updates, bump the patch version. These can easily be done by running `npm publish <version>`, where `version` is either `major`, `minor`, or `patch`.
